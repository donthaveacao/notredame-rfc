1. make part
2. New >> Manufacturing
3. import reference model
    set to default
4. create CSYS on top corner of part
5. note: TECHNO is x = southward, y = eastward
6. create workcenter
    set to default
7. create operation
    a. choose coord system
    b. set clearance (0.5, generally)
    c. check finish
8. sequences
    note: bolt down pieces, sometimes? before cutting. consider
    a. Mill >> Profile Milling
      i. create tool
      ii. set flute diam, length
      iii. apply, OK
      iv. CLEAR_DIST: 0.5
      v. SPINDLE_SPEED: 13000
      vi. STEP_DEPTH: 1/2 of bit diam
      vii. CUT_FEED (feed rate): 65

chip load: based on MATERIAL and BIT_DIAM
(for HDPE ~0.006")
feed rate = no. flutes * chip load * RPM * 0.5 (NGEDDE Factor)
~= 2 * 0.006 * 13000 * 0.5 ~= 65

      viii. Go to reference (select profiled faces)
     
         note: for loop profile select, Anchor is "top face"

      ix. Check tool path

    b. volume rough
    c. hole mills: Standard >>
      i. define points, select points
      ii. must set plunge speed in machine!!!! (look up)

9. Manufacturing >> Save a CL File
    a. NC Sequence
    b. Select sequence name from list
    c. File >> (Check "Compute CL")
    d. Done
    e. Name file and save
    f. Done output

10. Manufacturing >> Post a CL File
    a. Select NCL File
    b. Open
    c. Done
    d. Select UNCX01.P20
      i. check Cycle Time (in minutes)
    e. use the .NC file

11. plunge speed = inch/min

12. File >> Open sequence
13. Preprocess
14. Start
